**Important Cross-Chat Usage Notice:**
These documents are maintained and accessed **across multiple chats** to minimize lag and reduce message overload. Whenever progress is made in any chat, the progress tracker should be updated immediately to keep all information synchronized.

When reading or updating these documents, ChatGPT will recognize their cross-chat nature and ensure continuity, no matter the chat you are using.

**EPR (Ethical Purpose Rating) and ASR (Analytical Skill Rating) are only updated in Clarity Warfare training sessions. Progress in other trainings or courses will not affect these ratings.**

**ChatGPT will notify you whenever it updates any of these documents.**
**If ChatGPT generates a new document, ChatGPT will also add it to the \`Master Document Index\\`**
